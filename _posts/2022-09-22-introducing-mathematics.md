In this post, I'd like to discuss the troubles of beginners in the field of mathematics and then perhaps outline how I would go about instructing an interested new-comer to self-learn in the field of mathematics. Not everyone is a student, not everyone has the chance to go to university and not everyone has the money to pay for premium courses. Teaching autodidactic skills is key to equality among the field of knowledge. Knowledge should be free.

Mathematics is a wonderful subject, however, to the beginner or new-comer it often doesn't reveal its wonder. At a superficial glace, it looks like a muddy complication. Even worse, with a high-school level understanding, it looks like a coagulate of useless information that can be learned only through rote. In the modern-day system of academia, it is only the informed and enthusiastic individual that can see the intricacies, complexities and technicalities hollistically and as the source of beauty. It is the fact that those complexities can be so eloquently understood with intuitive, correct and pure proof that mathematics can be described as beautiful.

And I, the meagre and over-confident student, would like to show you but a hint of how to find that beauty for yourself. Though despite not being an expert of mathematics, I would like to think I have become somewhat adept at learning over the last 18 years or so. Of course, it's easier said than done but the existence of this post proves that it won't stop me.

To begin, the greenhorn student will likely find themselves unsure of their own knowledge and understanding of the subject and so even the idea of starting to learn is elusive. There are many ways to begin mathematics and if you do venture down this road, you will likely find yourself covering less advanced topics again with newer insights and ways to understand them. You likely learned arithmetic in school but it may be worth understanding at a later point how arithmetic arises from logic.

But to answer the question, it depends... I know this sounds like a bad answer but bear with me. The likelihood is you want a book or a course to start with and hit the ground running but don't know which book or course you should start with. I will create a simple ASCII diagram, in order of progression. Note that this ordering is not strict and certainly not all of mathematics. 
```
[ Arithmetic ]
 |
[ Pre-Algebra ]
 |
[ Algebra ]
 | 
[ Trig/Pre-Calculus ]
 |
 +-----------+ 
             |
[ Calculus ] & [ Complex Numbers ]
             |
 +-----------+
 |
[ Linear Algebra ]
 |
[ Mathematical Proofs ]
 |
[ Differential Equations ]
 |
 +-------------------+
                     |
[ Complex Analysis ] & [ Real Analysis ]  
```
Using this tree, a new-comer will likely start anywhere from `[ Arithmetic ]` to `[ Trig/Pre-Calculus ]`, you should be able to find a book or two on each of these topics (and those between). Look for some books with a service like [z-library](https://z-lib.org/) and read a little, does it seem easy? Skim to some of the excersises near the end. Decide this way where you should start. How rigorous you want to be in your understanding and learning is up to you.

For now, I'll leave it here, in the future I will come back to this and rewrite and edit it, linking more resources as I do.
