On {{ page.date | date: "%a, the %d of %b, %Y"}}, {{ page.author }} said let there be text, and there was, and it was glorious. This is the first post I have ever made and will remain as the initial post though it may (or may not) be changed in the next few commits.

Generally, I hope for this to become a general blog, though do note I am a Mathematics student and a developer so expect quite a few development/technology blogs as well as mathematical themed blogs. You can usually tell the general content of the blog by its title (and if not, the tags should give you a hint). My other interests will shine through in the form of music and anime reviews when the stochastic wave of literary motivation overcomes my innate desire to do nothing.

For the sake of taking up screen real estate, I'm going to briefly introduce myself so forgive any overlap with the last paragraph. I am **Pepsalt**(he/him), commonly called Pep. I study Computer Science & Mathematics at a university in the United Kingdom with plans to continue onto a PhD in Mathematics. I enjoy metalcore music and Japanese music. I enjoy anime. I enjoy software development. I enjoy maths.

I refuse to write more than this for it will only become obsolete as time moves on and an [about](/about) page exists with an expanded introduction.
